# Contract Disclosure Generator — README

This project provides a simple pipeline for generating clear, user-friendly disclosure sheets from uploaded contracts. It automatically extracts clauses, groups them, and uses an LLM to generate a human-readable disclosure summary.

---

##  Overview of the Workflow

1. User uploads a contract document (PDF, DOCX, TXT).
2. `clause_extractor.py`  
   → Extracts raw text and segments it into structured clauses.
3. `clause_finder.py` (optional)  
   → Classifies clauses into categories (Obligations, Risks, Restrictions, etc.).
4. `disclosure_generator.py`  
   → Generates a professional disclosure sheet using the structured clauses and an LLM.

##  Features

- Automatic clause extraction from messy contract text.
- Optional clause categorization using keyword heuristics.
- Clean, readable disclosure summaries generated by an LLM.
- Fully customizable prompt + formatting.
- Backend-friendly — designed to plug into FastAPI, Flask, or a CLI.

## How to set up
- Run ```pip install -r requirements.txt```
- Make sure to install the model of your choice, and edit the .env.example and .env file
- In the terminal, navigate to the folder where app.py is located:

```cd path/to/folder```


Then run:

```python app.py```


##  LLM Requirements

The generator assumes you’re using an LLM accessible via:

- OpenAI API  
- Ollama local model  
- Any model wrapped with a `.generate(prompt)` method

You must implement the function inside `disclosure_generator.py` depending on your provider.

##  How to Use

### 1. Extract Clauses

```python
from clause_extractor import extract_clauses

clauses = extract_clauses("contract.pdf")
```

### 2. Categorize Clauses

```python
from clause_finder import categorize_clauses

categorized = categorize_clauses(clauses)
```

### 3. Generate the Disclosure

```python
from disclosure_generator import generate_disclosure

disclosure = generate_disclosure(categorized)
print(disclosure)
```

##  Output Format

Example of the improved disclosure style:

```

##  Files Explained

### `clause_extractor.py`
- Loads document text.
- Splits into clauses using headings, numbering, and line-based heuristics.
- Returns a list of clause objects.

### `clause_finder.py` (optional)
- Uses keyword matching to identify clause categories.
- Helps the generator produce cleaner summaries.

### `disclosure_generator.py`
- Takes structured clauses.
- Sends them to an LLM.
- Formats a concise disclosure sheet.

##  Testing

Run quick tests:

```bash
python clause_extractor.py
python clause_finder.py
python disclosure_generator.py
```

## Notes

- This tool assists with clarity but **is not legal advice**.
- Always review generated output manually.
- You can customize the disclosure tone (simple, friendly, formal, warning-heavy).
